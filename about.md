Hello! I am a third year Computer Science major at UC Berkeley. Despite having completed all undergraduate Machine Learning classes, I am currently focusing on Networking & Security. I enjoy pursuing challenging Software Architecture projects, such as designing new frameworks and building large scale flexible systems.

This website serves as a hub for my resume, projects, and blog. I will also be using it as an archive for my past endeavors. I love working on startup projects and am actively looking for job opportunities. Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me! You can find my contact information on [my resume](/assets/Orkun Duman - Resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
