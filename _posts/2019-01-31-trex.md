**TrexBot is a project in progress.** When there is no internet Chrome lets us play this fun, basic game of jumping and dodging obstacles. Trex can get very addictive. TrexBot solves this problem using computer vision and machine learning. It is able to achieve scores more than `4,000` and is [open source (TBA)](https://github.com/orkun1675/trex-bot/){:target="_blank"} if you want to use it.
