Hello! I am a junior at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science. Despite haven taken all undergraduate Machine Learning classes, I am currently focusing on Networking & Security. I enjoy challenging Software Architecture projects such as designing a new Framework to make further development simpler.

This website serves as a hub for my resume, projects, and blog. I will also be using it as an archive for my past endeavors. I love working on startup projects and am actively looking for job opportunities. So if you want to contact me, don't hesitate to [check out my resume](/assets/Orkun Duman - Resume.pdf).
