A java based Minecraft community server. This project started in 2013 and quickly became popular in Turkey. As a result, I started a company around the service and hired teammates to help me. Together we reached 270.000 users and made considerable profit before having to shut down. The legacy website design can be found on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/36293013/NoMercyMC-Website-Design){:target="_blank"}.
