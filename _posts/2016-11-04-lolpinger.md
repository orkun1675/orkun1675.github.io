A simple menu-bar application for Mac OS X devices (10.10+) that lets the user select which [League of Legends](https://leagueoflegends.com) server they wish to play on and shows them their current ping (delay) to this server. Does not require LoL to be running. [Available on the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lolping-helper/id1170984083?mt=12) and is [open source](https://github.com/orkun1675/LoLPing/).
